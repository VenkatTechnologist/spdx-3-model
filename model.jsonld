A purl is a URL string which represents a package in a mostly universal and uniform way across programming languages, package managers, packaging conventions, tools, APIs and databases.\n\nthe purl URL string is defined by seven components:\n```\nscheme:type/namespace/name@version?qualifiers#subpath\n```\n\nThe definition for each component can be found in the [purl specification](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-SPECIFICATION.rst). Components are designed such that they form a hierarchy from the most significant on the left to the least significant components on the right. \n\nParsing a purl string into its components works from left to right. Some extra type-specific normalizations are required. For more information, see [How to parse a purl string in its components](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-SPECIFICATION.rst#how-to-parse-a-purl-string-in-its-components).",

A common example is when software is offered under a choice of one or more licenses (e.g., GPL-2.0-only OR BSD-3-Clause). Another example is when a set of licenses is needed to represent a binary program constructed by compiling and linking two (or more) different source files each governed by different licenses (e.g., LGPL-2.1-only AND BSD-3-Clause).\n\nSPDX License Expressions provide a way for one to construct expressions that more accurately represent the licensing terms typically found in open source software source code. A license expression could be a single license identifier found on the SPDX License List; a user defined license reference denoted by the LicenseRef-idString; a license identifier combined with an SPDX exception; or some combination of license identifiers, license references and exceptions constructed using a small set of defined operators (e.g., AND, OR, WITH and +). We provide the definition of what constitutes a valid an SPDX License Expression in this section.",
